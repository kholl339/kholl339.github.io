<p>My name is Kailey Holloway and I'm a senior communications major at Bob Jones University. I'm from the great state of Wisconsin, and I cannot wait to go home for Christmas to the snow and lights!</p>
<p>I would love to work as a Child Life Specialist after I graduate from college. Not many people know what a CLS is, so please follow the link below to read some more about it.</p>

<p>My little sister had a CLS when she was younger, during and after quite a few surgeries. I am so excited to be able to make some of the difference that her CLS' made in her life!</p>
<p>I love my town of Marshfield, Wisconsin. If you ever need a relaxing, slow-paced, and beautiful vacation spot, come on up to northern Wisconsin!</p>
